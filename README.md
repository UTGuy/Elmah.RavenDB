# Elmah.RavenDB

Elmah.RavenDB is a [RavenDB](http://ravendb.net) storage backend for 
[ELMAH](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/).

## License

Elmah.RavenDB itself is licensed under the MIT license.

## Installation

Elmah.RavenDB can be installed in two ways. The easiest is to install 
the Elmah package that includes all the config, 
then install Elmah.RavenDB which will add the errorLogger to the 
`<elmah>` config section.

    PM> Install-Package elmah
    PM> Install-Package Elmah.RavenDB

The second method works better if you already have ELMAH installed or 
you wish to do all the configuration manually. Simply install the 
Elmah.RavenDB package.

    PM> Install-Package Elmah.RavenDB

## Connection Strings

Both of these installation methods configure the RavenDbErrorLog to
use a connectionString named "Elmah". You will need to manually 
edit the connection strings to add a valid RavenDB connection string.

e.g.

    <connectionStrings>
        <add name="Elmah" connectionString="Url=http://localhost:8080;Database=MyApp.Elmah" />
    </connectionStrings>

## Use an external configured store

Besides using a connection string you could also provide an instance of an IDocumentStore at the startup of your application.

    protected void Application_Start()
    {
       _store = new EmbeddableDocumentStore
       {
         RunInMemory = true               
       };

       _store.Initialize();

       RavenDbErrorLog.ConfigureWith(_store);
       //...     
    }

Please make sure that you have finished the configuration before any errors could occur which should be handled by ELMAH.

***Warning***: A configured connection string will be ignored if you have passed an RavenDB store to `ConfigureWith`
